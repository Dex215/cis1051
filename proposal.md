# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Green Mammoth fuzz

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a fuzz VST plugin that is programmed in C++ using the JUCE framework.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will take a signal (probobly a guitar input) and give it fuzz. It will include a master volume control, gain, and tone. The function i am planning on using for the fuzz is f(x) = tanh(Gx) with x being the input, 
f(x) being the output, and G being the gain 1-10.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functional fuzz plugin.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional fuzz plugin with user adjustments

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional fuzz plugin with user adjustments that gives me the sound I'm happy with. I can't find any good fuzz plugins that I really like so creating the first great one is ambitios
but I think I will be able to make one that I am happy with.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am still becoming acostomed to the JUCE framework and c++ in general as the only language I have experience with so far is python. 
My next steps will be:
-Become familiar with C++
-Research Fuzz curcuits (I found 2 stanford digital audio FX papers that are already proving to be useful)
-implement fuzz curcuit into my program
