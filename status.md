Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I am learning C++ and the JUCE framework and I've created a basic gain plugin

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to program the fuzz, tone knob, and make the GUI look how I want, right now it is
just the default JUCE GUI

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I spent a LOT of time trying to build the plugin at first and leaning enough C++ to be compitent
enough to do even basic tasks took a while.
