# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have 2 ideas about what I want to make my final project about. I will do more research before the real proposal.
Here are my ideas:

1. I am somewhat dislexic and I noticed that there is only one VS Code theme for dislexic people (and in my opinion, it's not very good) so I was thinking about using openDislexic's monospaced font to make a vsCode theme specificly for dislexic people.

2. My original idea was to create a program that writes a unique metal guitar riff and generates a midi file that can be played back

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan on working with anyone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I am worried that the dislexia extension might be a lackluster final project so I would like feedback on that idea. 

Also I am unsure about how to write a midi file in python, but I found a video of a guy writing a program that turns user input into midi so I think that could be a good jumping off point but any tips or feedback you have would be greatly appriciated.
